Welcome to the 'Tuple Out Dice Game'

In this project, I have implemented a simulation of a simple dice game called "Tuple Out"!

Here's how it works & the rules:
+ Each turn, the player rolls three dice
+ - If all 3 dice have the SAME value, those are "fixed" numbers and cannot be re-rolled.
  - If the dice shows numbers that are NOT "fixed", then they can re-roll any of those dice and can do so until they decide they're done rolling
+ When the player decides to STOP rolling, they score points which is equal to the total of the three dice added together, and their turn ends.

Requirements:
+ Python 3.11.5
+ panda library
+ matplotlib

How to Play!
+ Setting up your system:
+ -  Make sure you have Python 3.11.5 installed on your system.
  - Make sure you have Panda Library downloaded 
  - Make sure you have Matplotlib downloaded
+ Running the game:
+   open the 'final inst project.py"

+   Game:
-  enter the number of players when prompted
-  each player takes turns rolling 3 dice
-  If all three dice show the same number, the player "tuples out" and scores zero points for that turn.
-  If two dice show the same number, the player has the option to re-roll the third die.
-  The player can choose to stop rolling at any time and score points equal to the sum of the three dice.
-  The game continues until one player reaches a score of 50 or more.
-  The player with the highest score wins the game. 

Contributors I would like to thank! : 
+ To Rukayat Fakoya, for the paired programming session and the Code Review! In this session, we wanted to explain our projects to each other so that we had a basis for what our end result should look like. We wanted to get a different perspective on what to keep and delete from our first consolidation project and how to build up from that. 
+ To Ines Zheng, for the paired programming session! We focused on making sure that each other's code had a good foundation to keep adding on to. We also reviewed the goals we wanted to accomplish with our code and overall final project while making sure we were meeting the criteria for each other's project.
+ To Vatsala Pigilam, for the paired programming session! We mainly delved into refining our consolidation projects for the final project submission. Reviewing each other's code, we identified areas for improvement and incorporated strategies into our work, if applicable. We went through how I could make the layout of my code more organized so it was easier to edit and refine little details.
+ To Andre James Soriano, for the paired programming session! We mainly tested our versions of our final projects, and went through them line by line, to identify any problems that we were running into and we made note of them to fix for later. This was helpful in realizing what was causing some problems in our code and why other parts of our code might have not run correctly.
