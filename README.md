Welcome to the 'Tuple Out Dice Game'

In this project, I have implemented a simulation of a simple dice game called "Tuple Out"!

Here's how it works & the rules:
+ Each turn, the player rolls three dice
+ - If all 3 dice have the SAME value, those are "fixed" numbers and cannot be re-rolled.
  - If the dice shows numbers that are NOT "fixed", then they can re-roll any of those dice and can do so until they decide they're done rolling
+ When the player decides to STOP rolling, they score points which is equal to the total of the three dice added together, and their turn ends.

Requirements:
+ Python 3.11.5
+ panda library
+ matplotlib

Usage:
