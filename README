Introduction to the 'Tuple Out Dice Game'

 In this project, I've implemented a simulation of a simple dice game called "Tuple Out"

Game Rules
+ Each turn, the player rolls three dice.
+ If all three dice show the same number, the player "tuples out" and ends their turn with zero points"
+ If two dice have the same value, those are "fixed" and can't re-rolled
+ The player can re-roll any dice that are not "fixed" and they can do so until they decided to stop or they "tuple out"
+ When the player decides to stop, they score points equal to the total of the three dice added together, and their turn ends.

Requirements:
+ Python 3.11.5 

Usage:
+ 1. to
